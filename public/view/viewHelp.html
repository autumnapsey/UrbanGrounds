	 <p class="nowWorkingText">We haven't built out a database for our application yet, but we still wanted to roll out Urban Grounds as soon as possible. So in the meantime, you can download something called a CORS Extension for Google Chrome <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-control-allow-origi/nlfbmbojpeacfghkpbjhddihlkkiljbi?hl=en" target="_blank" id="corsLink">here</a>. Once you have it installed, turn it on, and all of our API information will load for you. Don't worry, it won't hurt your computer, but remember to turn it off when you're done or things like Facebook and iCloud might not work properly.</p>
